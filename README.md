# The Syracuse Conjecture
The Syracuse Conjecture is a very simple problem that noone has ever solved. It works by taking 1 number, any number of your choice, and if it is even you divide by 2, and if it is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1. The goal is to never end up at the number 1 because it just results in a 4, 2, 1 loop.

Example:
20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1...

I picked 20 as the first number. I divided it by 2 because it is even. 10 is even so I divided it by 2 and got 5. 5 is odd, so I multiplied it by 3 and added 1 and got 16. 16 is even so I devided it by 2, etc.

This program works by trying to try every number in existence and seeing if a number breaks the pattern of ending up in a 4, 2, 1 loop.
